            <input class="title" value="MY REFLECTIONS ON ANDELA’S EPIC VALUES"/><br><br>
            <textarea>Andela is a developer’s company that specializes in training software developers around the world. Andela’s mission is to advance human potential by powering today’s teams and investing in tomorrow’s leaders.
            EPIC at Andela starts for the following
            E- Excellence
            P-Passion
            I-Integrity
            C-Collaboration
            Excellence
            In Andela, Andelans totally believe in excellence which is directed to doing any task assigned to you to your best ability, striving to be the best that you can be. They are learners who strive for mastery of their craft. This excellence is archived through asking for help from others and also giving as much help as you can to others especially when one is stuck. Writing code of the highest quality, this adheres to best practices which motivates them to learn continuously and ensure that one is growing. These practices also ensure Andelans have a growth mindset. My understanding of this excellent value is consistently being outstanding or good irrespective of the circumstance.
            Passion
            To me, the willingness of a person to suffer for a cause of something in order to be a victor is how I would understand this passion. Being able to have less sleep to deliver a task given. The understanding that nothing is impossible once you have something at heart and at the soul.
            Integrity
            well according to me integrity means doing the right thing in all circumstances, even if no one is watching you. integrity means you are true to yourself and would do nothing that demeans or dishonors you. This involves writing my own code and being accountable for it at all times. Mistakes are inevitable and so incase they happen one should seek to limit their impact and also learn from them so as to avoid them in the future.also in case of a mistake one should be able to accept and take responsibility of it.I also think of integrity as a way of achieving a good maintaining environment, and no blench of rules like respecting other people.
            Collaboration.
            This is what I call the action of working with someone or other people to produce something.this also 
            involves being an active member of a group that is working together to achieve a common goal. Being an active
             member may include you not only participate in conversations, meetings and interactions passively (i.e. only
              listening and learning) but you add your piece of contribution to the group.at Andela, there is a provision
               on where collaboration can be demonstrated this platform is slack.this is where all the sharing of ideas 
               happens keeping in mind respect for others.</textarea>
